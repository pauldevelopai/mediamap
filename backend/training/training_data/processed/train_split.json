    "output": "in return for the value they derive. Therefore, value can flow from one stakeholder to another. The absence of such a value flow may deprive certain stakeholders of the benefits they derive from journalism. For example, audiences pay for journalism with their money, time and data – to the benefit media owners, investors, advertisers and investors – in return for the value they (audience members) derive from the journalism they consume, which may have more to do with non-financial benefits such as a sense of identity or the ability to express themselves. If audience members think they are not benefitting enough from journalism, they will likely stop paying for it with their money, time and personal data, depriving other stakeholders of the benefits they are looking for. Increasingly, audiences get information from many places and it must be clear why one media outlet’s journalism has more benefits than that of another and what the first outlet does better. This is a media outlet’s ‘value proposition’. This depends on how a media outlet’s journalism is perceived as being different to that of others. The qualities derived from ethical principles – factual, non-partisan journalism that informs members of the public about issues that shape their lives and challenge social norms – differentiate public interest journalism from other forms of media content, not least misinformation and disinformation. But other media outlets might also espouse these principles and values, in which case the ways stories are produced and designed, how easy they are to access and use, and how audiences and other stakeholders experience them, are also part of this value proposition. A media outlet combines these various factors as stories are researched, produced and distributed, and through its engagement with audience members and other stakeholders along the way. Journalists play a key role in gathering, making sense of/editing information and presenting stories in a way that appeals to their audience. But other stakeholders can also contribute to this value creation process. For example, audience members may contribute story ideas and information. They also help to distribute stories and encourage dialogue by sharing them and providing feedback. Meanwhile, media owners provide journalists with the resources they need to produce and distribute their stories; resources that are usually paid for through sales, advertising and other revenue. Society provides the context and meaning to stories as well as some of the infrastructure used to distribute them. Therefore, value creation is a fluid process with potential tensions that may require trade-offs between the interests of different stakeholders. For example, media owners may value the prestige and influence they derive from their outlet more than the needs of their audience. Journalists’ ethical principles may 15 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Chapter 2: A framework for ‘good journalism, better societies’Chapter 2: A framework for ‘good journalism, better societies’ mitigate against the commercial interests of media owners and advertisers, while audience members may not always appreciate the way journalists challenge social taboos.

Journalism Practice 17/9. p.1859.A key takeaway from a series of IMS staff webinars on media viability, held in 2020, was that the values espoused by media should drive their efforts to generate income:78 “There was a sense from the webinars’ presentations and discussions that good journalism can sell without undermining what media partners, their audiences, and IMS believe in.” In this respect, Martina Klárová’s analysis of how news leaders evaluate the success of a news story is informative, coming from someone who makes a living helping publishers to monetise their content:79 “The magic of a successful article goes beyond numbers – it ignites curiosity, sparks conversations, and provokes thought. In the quest for success, one should not be confined by data alone. Rather, go and seek out the intangible connections that resonate deeply with your readers. It is these elements of empathy, authenticity, and a genuine passion to enlighten that truly set an article apart. After all, the road to success is not just paved with data – it is built on the foundation of genuine human connections and lasting impact.” 46 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Key termsChapter 5: The evidence courage” rather than “old-fashioned journalistic grit” allows journalists to go to great lengths to cover conflict and to expose crime and corruption.92 Both, it seems, are needed to avoid the “moral injury” and emotional burnout that many journalists experience from covering issues that violate their personal morals and values.93 94 95 Empathy, emotional intelligence, moral courage, and the risk of moral injury converge when journalists cover political violence. Photojournalist Joseph Mathenge’s coverage of the Westgate Shopping Mall siege in Nairobi, Kenya, in 201496 won awards, not for the sensationalism of his photos but the sensitivity he showed towards the people he photographed:97 “His colleagues all mentioned one word concerning Joseph’s work: empathy. Joseph Mathenge showed great empathy towards the victims on the scene.” Similarly, photojournalist Mimi Chakarova’s decision not to show the potentially sensational scars born by the women she met during her seven-year investigation into the plight of sex trafficking victims from Eastern Europe made an impression on fellow freelancer Barbara Matejcic:98 “That kind of a decision implies a large dose of basic human empathy and a lack of journalistic",

    "output": "what must be done to improve value creation to keep them viable”.65 This requires commitment to and utilisation of journalism’s fundamental values to create better value for key stakeholders in journalism: consumers, advertisers, media investors, journalists, and society.66 T ypes of value Value reflects the worth of something: its importance and usefulness, what we appreciate about it. “Value is in the mind of the consumer and is a measure of the worth or importance placed on a product or service”.67 One measure of value is the amount of money something is worth. But there are other ways we assess value, particularly when it comes to the ethics and beliefs that shape the way we think and behave. “Intrinsic value” reflects the ultimate importance of something, the factors that make it valuable in its own right. From a business and finance perspective, this is the ultimate value that something has, taking into consideration all factors and not just the price it fetches in a market.68 45 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Key termsChapter 5: The evidence V aluable journalism Olsen’s value creation model “casts audiences in a role as active co-creators of value, rather than passive recipients of a value delivery… Being sensitive to what audiences truly appreciate is an urgent objective for news operations”.80 Costera Meijer has identified three experiences of journalism that audience members considered valuable:81 • Getting recognition. • Learning something new. • Increasing mutual understanding. These experiences are achieved by applying the six “journalistic virtues”: accuracy, sincerity, listening, hospitality, being a good friend, and keeping a proper distance.82 However, these virtues may not always be compatible and therefore may require journalists to negotiate which virtues are most important in a particular story or context.83Shifts in journalism practice Ironically, the art of storytelling is emerging as an antidote to journalism’s current existential crisis, prompting changes in journalism practice that seem to reflect the shifts in ethical principles and news values referred to earlier. “We used to think our (journalism’s) power was in reach, audience, and storytelling. We have lost our reach, and we don’t necessarily have the audience anymore. So, the only thing we’re left with is storytelling. If we start with the acceptance of that, then let’s see what we can build.”84 Innovation and re-invention Recognising that “the plurality of audiences, behaviours and technologies challenge the classic models of journalism in a way that encourages innovation”, Moreira Flores identifies three areas of change in “journalism as a process and product”: content and narrative, technology and format, and business model.85 Forms of storytelling used by novelists are more effective in transferring knowledge to news consumers than journalism’s inverted pyramid,86 which has been journalists’ stock-in-trade ever since space and speed became a premium for newspaper publishers (Kulkarni et al., 2022):87 “While the professional norms, habits, and preferences exercised by journalists might be much less easy to redefine, our research suggests that it might be innovation in the narrative structure that makes online news more engaging, convenient, and useful than the alternatives currently available.” 78 Lush,",

Analytical (trying to make sense of things, offering interpretations of events, policies, laws etc.).This is what most differentiates us from other media: we take time to make sense of things, to explain issues in an easy-to-understand way that is presented in attractive and user-friendly formats. This should appeal to a new audience segment and make more people aware of, and appreciate, the topics we cover. But we will need to maintain our ‘user-friendly’ approach to journalism as we implement/ fine-tune our new, unfamiliar formats. The appeal of our analytical coverage will help us increase our revenue and provide investors with a return on their investment.Audience Practical – this helps people understand issues and to apply our coverage to their daily lives. It helps people connect with others because they understand the topics we cover. Lasting – respect and a sense of being taken seriously because audience can understand the topics we cover. Media outlet Practical – appealing to our new audience with distinct, analytical coverage will boost our income, our directors’ return on investment, and provide a new audience for our current and potential advertisers. Lasting – prestige, influence, and a competitive edge as we become the ‘go-to’ media outlet for people who want to understand the issues we cover.

If you are not clear about your vision and values, it would be helpful to think these through before designing your editorial strategy. Some media outlets have an organisational strategy and/or business plan that explains the organisation’s vision and core values. Others may not. IMS has separate tools for helping media partners to develop them. Most – but not necessarily all – journalists and media outlets recognise a code of ethics and some form of non-judicial mechanism (e.g. a media council or in-house role), that ensures the code is followed, and to which members of the public can complain if they feel the outlet’s coverage is VISION AND VALUES Think ahead. Try to imagine how you would like your media outlet to be in five years’ time: • Who will it serve? • What will it cover? • What values will it espouse? • How will it look/sound/feel?ETHICAL PRINCIPLES What are the ethical principles that guide your journalism? • Where are these principles written down, (e.g. in a code of ethics or practice?) If they are not written down, try to use this opportunity to identify your ethical principles so you can refer to them later. • Who makes sure you apply these principles, and to whom can members of the public complain if they think you have gone against these principles? 8 https://ethicaljournalismnetwork.org/resourcesin breach of this code. If you do not have a code of ethics, organisations representing the media in your country may be able to advise you. The Ethical Journalism Network8 might also provide you with inspiration and examples of best practice.

You can then refer to this as you continue with the next steps. Tip: If your team is big enough, you could divide into three groups – on for audiences, one for the media outlet and one for your society - and each group discusses and answers the questions in relation to their assigned stakeholder. Each group can then present their ideas to the whole team for further discussion and agreement on the impact you want to have. Otherwise, if the team is small, you can brainstorm together.STEP 2: AIMING FOR IMPACT Keeping your institutional vision and values in mind, discuss and agree what impact, i.e. beneficial change,",

    "output": "the strategy (this includes Step 6 and 7 ) • making sure that people responsible for different parts of the strategy, e.g. data gathering and helping journalists to implement it, play their part. Tip: Ideally the editor or another senior decision-maker should oversee the strategy. However, everyone has a part to play in implementing and reviewing it. You might want different team members to be responsible for monitoring and reviewing the implementation of each priority principle/value. Try to assign roles and responsibilities as the final part of Step 5. Alternatively, the person with overall responsibility can do this later, but preferably as soon as possible, so that people know what they are expected to do.While keeping in mind the impact you want your journalism to have and the value you want this to create for key stakeholders, try answering the following questions for each priority principle/value: 1. How can you apply this principle/value to how you, a) research, b) produce c) distribute your stories and engage with your audiences? What approaches, methods and tools can you use to enhance your journalism in a way that has the impact and creates the value you want? Are there any activities you can organise? 2. How will the practices you identified above contribute towards the impact and value you want to have? 3. How will you know these practices are having the impact and creating the value you want? What information can tell you this (see sources you identified in the worksheets for Steps 2 and 3 ) and who is responsible for gathering and analysing this information? 4. What additional resources, e.g. skills, knowledge, time, money and so on, might you need to practice your journalism this way? Who is responsible for the availability of resources?STEP 5: PUTTING PRIORITIES INTO PRACTICE Now you can decide how – in your day-to-day journalism – you want to apply the ethical principles and editorial values that you prioritised in Step 4, in ways that will have the desired impact while creating value for your key stakeholders. PLANNING The worksheet for Steps 5 and 7 will become your plan for this (see template in Appendix section). You can come back and revise it, if necessary, each time you review your strategy, as described in Step 7. First enter the relevant information from the worksheet for Step 4: • decide which ethical principles and institutional values your journalism should focus on. • assess whether these principles, values, and practices create enough value for you audience, your media outlet, and your society.Chapter 4 / Step 5: Putting priorities into practice Tips: 1. As you answer each question, add your final answers to the corresponding columns in worksheet for Steps 5 and 7. 2. You could divide the team into groups and assign each group a priority principle/ value to work on using the template. Then come back together, so each group can explain what it has done. Other groups can then make suggestions until the plan for each principle/value is agreed. 33 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better",

In journalism, ethical principles and editorial values combine to shape how journalism is practiced. Journalists’ ethical principles are usually enshrined in a code of ethics or guidelines overseen by a ‘self- regulatory mechanism’; a body or individual with some independence who can receive complaints from the public, assess these in terms of the relevant ethical standards and take some form of corrective action if necessary. These arbiters might be recognised by all or part of a media sector, such as a media council or by an individual media outlet, such as a readers’ editor or in-house ombudsperson. But they are usually a backstop with little direct influence over how journalism is practiced day-to-day. Routine journalism practice – how stories are selected and edited, who journalists chose to interview, the angles we take in our stories, how stories are filmed, photographed, illustrated, recorded, and so on – tends to be shaped more by a media outlet’s editorial values, which are usually a pragmatic mixture of professional ethics and the values held by the outlet’s owners, its journalists and the communities in which they live and work.Ideally ethical standards and editorial values reinforce each other. But political, commercial or social pressures – as well as the personal beliefs and interests of shareholders, editors, and journalists – can override ethical standards. This often-subtle undermining of editorial values and ethical standards can cause audiences and the wider public to grow disillusioned with a media outlet’s coverage and seek alternatives. Media outlets can avoid this by having a strategy for systematically applying their ethical principles and editorial values in their research, production and distribution of stories and through engagement with their audience. Journalists can then refine their practice and hold each other accountable in a mutually supportive way by monitoring and assessing the progress they make with implementing their strategy. Creating value The application of ethical principles and editorial values determines the quality of journalism. But that does not necessarily make journalism valuable to those best placed to sustain it: the audience that consumes the journalism; the media outlet’s owners, investors, journalists, marketers, administrators and advertisers who provide the skills and resources to produce and distribute the journalism; and the wider society that the journalists and media serve.

What we publish or broadcast may be hurtful, but we should be aware of the impact of our words and images on the lives of others.” Wasserman considers human dignity as an ethical principle for media in a young democracy like South Africa, as it “can enhance citizen voices and contribute to the development of their capabilities”.53 However, politicians can use this as a “spurious defence against the media’s unearthing of corruption and wrongdoing” and, therefore, human dignity manifests in the “ethics of listening”, which entails journalists:54• Listening attentively to stories, especially those of people who might not otherwise be heard “because they find themselves too often in the shadows of the public sphere”, and to “their narratives about their everyday lives, their struggles but also their victories, their pain but also their pleasures”. • Making a proactive intervention to try and change society “rather than just mirroring it as it already is”. • Becoming “gate openers” rather than “gatekeepers” by decentralising the power structures inherent in media production and involving news subjects “as equal partners in the production process”. • Departing from “the professional ideology of control and dissemination of information into a much more interactive, reciprocal relationship with citizens”. 46 Schwaiger, C.

Ethics “rarely provide clear answers about the best way to handle quandaries” but are rather “about asking the ‘right’ questions to best illuminate our duties and potential impacts on others”.19 To function effectively, journalism requires independent and ethical editorial systems, good governance and transparency in management, and a commitment to accountability that ensures engagement with the audience and responds to its concerns. In the digital age, ethical journalism is a distinctive form of communications that “is about the sharing of ‘other regarding’ information which delivers news and commentary in a process shaped by public interest and community values”:21“(Ethical journalism) is practiced by people who exercise self-restraint and who gain credibility and public trust by working according to an agreed code of principles. This is in sharp contrast to other voices in the public information space – political spin, corporate public relations, or social networks, for instance – who engage in ‘self-regarding’ communications, often reflecting the political, commercial or cultural bias of special interests or simply driven by personal prejudice.” From objectivity to empathy and solidarity For a long time, objectivity was considered a cornerstone of ethical journalism but there is a growing realisation that like everyone else, journalists have their own views, biases, and prejudices. Instead of pretending these can somehow be put aside, journalists should be aware of/honest about them and keep an open mind while actively seeking out different perspectives. Acknowledging this shift in perspective, IMS chose “fairness” rather than objectivity as one of the ethical principles it recognised in 2018.22 The same could be said for emotions. Wahl- Jorgensen identifies the “emotional turn” in journalism studies that has coincided with the emergence of digital and social media.23 Even conventional “hard news genres” are shaped by an engagement with emotion, which points to a more empathetic approach to journalism that has previously been obscured by the view of journalists as “detached observers”.24 Empathy is a psychological construct that describes how individuals react cognitively and emotionally to another person’s 14 Berger, G.

    "output": "societies’ in practice Chapter 4: Guide to designing and implementing your editorial strategy STORY CHECKLIST Using the story checklist template included in the Appendix section, your journalists can make a quick assessment to see which aspects of the strategy are addressed in a story they are planning. Editors can also use the checklist to assess the stories they are editing. Using the checklist can inspire new ideas and story angles: it can also help colleagues to become more familiar with the strategy. 1. Cut-and-paste the relevant information from the strategy into the template and then give each journalist and editor in your team a copy of the checklist. 2. Journalists and editors then run through the questions as they plan and edit stories. 3. If you have a physical newsroom, you could also put a copy of the checklist on the wall to remind the team of what you are trying to achieve together. (See example that follows.)Tip: Over time, these exercises should help the team to internalise the strategy and feel responsible for it. One way would be to make ‘story sharing’ a feature of editorial or other team meetings. Encourage all members of the team to select stories, perhaps on rotation. Once you have curated some stories, you could publish your findings as a way of explaining and demonstrating your strategy to your audience and getting their feedback. Journalists and editors can also provide feedback from their use of the story checklist.STEP 6: IMPLEMENTING YOUR STRATEGY Now you need to integrate your strategy into the organisation’s day-to-day practices and routines. These changes in behaviour can take time and it might be worth starting with a specific project or a team to instruct and inspire others as you roll out the strategy across the whole organisation. The following tools might also help.Chapter 4 / Step 6: Implementing your strategy CURATING EXAMPLES OF STORIES WITH VALUES, VALUE AND IMPACT As you implement your strategy, you can ask team members to share stories they think demonstrate how you are putting your editorial strategy into practice. You can ask team members to explain: 1. What aspect(s) of the editorial strategy does the story demonstrate – which ethical principles/editorial values were applied in the story? 2. How does the story contribute to the impact you want your journalism to have and the value you want it to create? Consider asking team members to identify stories that they feel have not applied the strategy and discuss how these stories could be improved. You can use the Worksheet for Step 6: Curating examples of stories with values, value and impact to document these examples and to record your answers to the questions (see template in Appendix section). 34 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Chapter 4: Guide to designing and implementing your editorial strategyChapter 4 / Step 6: Implementing your strategy EXAMPLE OF WORKSHEET FOR STEP 6: CHECKLIST FOR STORIES WITH VALUES, VALUE, AND IMPACT (1 OF 2) The answers to the checklist below are based on the author’s eye-witness account of",

If your team is big enough, you could assign small working groups to take responsibility for each value/standard in the strategy. Each working group could then analyse their part of the strategy, ahead of the review meeting, and bring to that meeting their findings and recommendations, which everyone then discusses, and agreement is reached.STEP 7: REVIEWING YOUR PROGRESS, ADJUSTING YOUR STRATEGY On a regular basis, perhaps every six months, take time to assess how well you are progressing with implementing your strategy and to see whether you need to do anything differently: 1 Ahead of the progress review meeting, each team member a. Reviews the data gathered to assess the impact and value created (under ‘Monitoring the impact and value of your journalism’ in the worksheet). b. Fills in the accompanying Self-Assessment of Progress scoresheet (see template in Appendix section). 2. The team then comes together to share the findings from scoresheets and discuss the following: a. How satisfied are you with your progress? b. Which aspects of the editorial strategy do you seem to be addressing the most? c. Are you focusing on some aspects of the strategy more than others? Do you need to emphasise other aspects of the strategy? d. What do the findings tell you about the impact your journalism is having and the value it is creating? e. What, if anything, do you need to do differently? 3. Then enter your findings in the relevant ‘Progress update’ columns in the worksheet for Steps 5 and 7.

Adding a simple step in your process to review relevant regulations in your region can help you avoid potential legal issues down the road. What’s next | Monitor, evaluate and adapt Once you’ve mapped your AI risks and solutions, it’s important to share this with everyone in your newsroom and assign owners to different AI use cases to continually monitor, evaluate, and adapt as the technology evolves. Schedule regular check-ins (e.g., quarterly) to: • Review existing and new AI tools being used in your newsroom • Assess how well your ethical solutions are working • Update policies/guidelines based on emerging ethical concerns • Share lessons learned across departments • Document feedback from staff • Create clear testing protocols before deploying new AI tools • Maintain logs of all issues encountered and how they were resolved. By developing responsible AI practices now, your newsroom will be better positioned to adapt to future technological developments while maintaining trust with your audience. This balanced approach allows you to benefit from AI’s capabilities while maintaining the human judgment, ethics, and accountability that make journalism valuable to society. 7 THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION NEWSROOM AI POLICY GUIDE This resource was developed by the Thomson Reuters Foundation, based on insights from our research and training programmes for newsrooms in the Global South.

    "output": "it their money, time, and attention.70 This “value proposition” is determined, for example, by the quality of journalism, the design of journalism products, their availability and usability, along with additional features and experiences they may offer.71 This is created throughout journalism’s “value chain”, the process by which journalism is researched, edited, designed, packaged, curated, and distributed.72While journalists play a crucial role in this value creation process, they rely on money, information, and other inputs provided by media owners and investors, audience members, advertisers, and the wider society. Journalism creates value for all these various stakeholders.73 However, Olsen found that stakeholders in local news providers in Norway may perceive the value of journalism differently, “which suggests that news media’s value creation is not a friction free process but rather a complex set of inter- actions between parties and interests that may or may not be aligned”.74 Balancing interests Olsen’s integrated value creation model identifies “value flows and gaps” between local newspaper businesses, audiences, and society that emerge from these stakeholders’ converging and conflicting interests,75 which suggests that when it comes to journalism, and public interest journalism in particular, value creation is a constant balancing act that involves weighing various stakeholders’ interests. As media have become increasingly reliant on audiences for revenue, audience data has become integral to the editorial decisions of many newsrooms. This data has tended to focus on metrics such as “clicks, likes and shares”, which have little to do with journalism ethics and editorial values,76 although some media are trying to measure quality too. The Guardian , for example, recently started measuring how “deeply” articles are read, with their lists of “most viewed” and “most deeply read” articles often containing completely different stories.77 65 Picard, R.G.

Using the handbook 2 The handbook starts from the premise that public interest journalism can and should contribute to a media outlet’s viability, which means that an outlet’s editorial and business strategies should reinforce each other. Ideally, an editorial strategy should be designed and implemented by teams made up of journalists and editors working together with managerial, marketing, technological, and operational colleagues. Chapter 1: Introduction 8 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Chapter 1: Introduction Chapter 1: Introduction ‘Good journalism, better societies’ is IMS’ mantra. Since its formation in 2001, the organisation has sought to provide journalists and other media content creators with the means to produce journalism that holds those with power to account and allows their audiences – in particular communities who wield less power – to participate in public life and claim their rights.3 This is in the belief that societies in which citizens have the freedom to express themselves and access reliable, information are ultimately more peaceful, just, equitable and inclusive. For journalism to play this role, media must also generate the income and operate in ways that allow them to keep producing good journalism that benefits society. That is why IMS’ support for story production goes hand-in-hand with its development of media operations, along with its efforts to create safe and enabling environments for media. But what does ‘good journalism, better societies’ mean in practice?Public interest journalism ‘Good journalism’ is shorthand for public interest journalism. IMS defines this as ethical, fact-based journalism that informs members of the public about issues that shape their lives in ways that: • serve the public’s rather than any political, commercial or factional interest, • encourage and informs public debate, • hold those in power to account, • challenge discriminatory societal norms.4 Public interest journalism not only strives to meet certain ethical standards. It also aims to have a beneficial impact for members of society. How this plays out in day-to-day journalism varies from country to country, and from media outlet to media outlet, depending on the ethical principles journalists and media outlets recognise, the editorial values they believe in and the impact they want their journalism to have. While ethical standards for journalism are similar the world over, their application is influenced by the norms and beliefs of the society in which journalists and their media outlets operate. Each media outlet’s version of public interest journalism is shaped by its ethical principles, its editorial values and the beneficial impact each outlet wants its journalism to have on the society it serves.3 IMS (2023). Global Strategy 2024-2028, p.11. 4 bid, p.29.Changing norms The traditional understanding of journalism’s role in relatively stable and prosperous liberal democracies with well-established media is not necessarily applicable in less liberal, less stable and less prosperous and less democratic parts of the world. Furthermore, technological changes over the past 20 to 30 years have transformed the ways in which journalism is produced and consumed. Journalism today is more focussed on audiences than perhaps ever before. Journalism is",

It is unlikely you can apply all these at the same time, so try to identify those that are most important for achieving the desired impact ( see Step 2 ). Use the worksheet for Step 4 to record what you decide (see example, and template in the Appendix section). Tip: Try to do this exercise as a team. Each member of the team could select two or three principles and values they find the most important and take turns to explain why. Once everyone in the team has done this, discuss the selections as a group.NEW NORMS? Then consider the changing norms highlighted in Chapter 3 and how these might relate to the impact you want to have. Add to the worksheet any as-yet unlisted norms that you think are important. Tip: There are no right or wrong answers to these questions – rather they are intended to help you assess whether there is anything you might not have thought of. Any additions should be compatible with your values and the impact you want Once you have done this, rank in order of importance the principles and values you have chosen as a team, while keeping in mind the impact you are aiming for. Tip: If you are doing this as a group, each member of the team could vote for their top principles and values.STEP 4: PRIORITISING YOUR PRINCIPLES, VALUES, AND IMPACT TO CREATE VALUE Now you can: • decide which ethical principles and institutional values your journalism should focus on. • assess whether these principles, values, and practices create enough value for you audience, your media outlet, and your society.Chapter 4 / Step 4: Prioritising your principles, values, and impact to create value 28 V",

This practical starter guide is designed to help newsrooms identify ethical risks in their AI applications and take action to mitigate these. It is intended as a starting point for ongoing conversations within your organisation on how to use AI while upholding journalistic values—accuracy, fairness, transparency, and accountability. These principles serve as essential pillars for informed communities worldwide, allowing journalism to fulfil its vital role in society. How to use this guide Each step in this guide builds on the previous one, helping you move from understanding your current AI usage to implementing responsible practices: We recommend involving journalists, editors, and technical staff in this process to ensure capturing diverse perspectives. REUTERS/Louafi Larbi01. Begin by taking stock of AI tools already in use in your newsroom02. Identify the common risks these tools pose to journalistic standards, and come up with solutions to address them 03. Establish ongoing monitoring to ensure continuous improvement 3 THOMSON REUTERS FOUNDATION NEWSROOM AI POLICY GUIDE Step 1: Identify your AI tools Before diving into the steps, let’s define what we mean by Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the context of newsrooms. In simple terms, AI refers to computer systems that are designed to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence. In newsrooms, this includes tools for transcription, translation, content editing, summarisation, and data analysis among others. The most widely used tools recently are Generative AI platforms like ChatGPT, Copilot, Gemini, and Claude that can produce text and/or visuals based on specific prompts. You probably already use many other tools with AI integrations without realising it, like spell-checkers that suggest writing improvements or transcription features that convert speech to text, or even simple features in Microsoft Excel that can help organise your data. Understanding what constitutes AI will help you take inventory of the AI tools already in use in your newsroom.

Sometimes values might be at odds with ethical principles. As a matter of principle, journalists strive to be accurate and fair, yet the countless studies have revealed that media coverage is often inherently biased. The Global Media Monitoring Project’s Who Makes the News study, for example, has found repeatedly that women are vastly underrepresented as both the subjects and sources of news stories.55 As the IMS ethical principles document points out:56 “Many ethical guidelines, codes, and regulatory mechanisms are blind to or silent about the media’s often prejudicial and misinformed coverage of women and other disadvantaged groups. Given that powerful cultural norms shape and dictate this coverage, we should go out of our way to ensure that these principles are applied equally to all sections of society in our journalism…” The recent fragmentation of media makes it more difficult to apply ethical standards. Regulatory and self- regulatory bodies responsible for media content may not have jurisdiction over what is published online. And many journalists now work from home, which dissipates 44 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Key termsChapter 5: The evidence Then there is “instrumental value”; factors that contribute towards achieving what is ultimately important; a means to an end. Something that is of instrumental value can “lose that value when it is no longer necessary to achieve the end in question” because something else can be used to achieve that end or “when the end in question is no longer desired”.69 Journalism’s value Journalism has both intrinsic and instrumental value. While it provides people with information to use in their day-to-day lives (instrumental value), this can also enhance people’s sense of identity, wellbeing, and purpose, which contributes to development and democracy (intrinsic value). For a long time, journalism has relied on this intrinsic value. But with many other sources of news and information now available, journalism must provide something different and more distinctive if people are to give",

Key aspects are value proposition, channels, market position, partners, revenues, and customers. This reflects an outlet’s business strategy, which is a roadmap for how management and staff will achieve the outlet’s goals and assess its progress. Business viability: refers to the business capabilities of media operations at the organisational level and being of service to a community, while implementing feasible business operations and staying financially afloat Editorial strategy: a broad plan for how journalism will contribute to a media outlet’s vision, mission and goals. This is different to a content strategy, which tends to cover all forms of content, including advertising, with a focus on marketing and an emphasis on data analysis and sales. While editorial strategy embraces many aspects of content strategy, particularly journalism’s relationship with its audience, this handbook distingiushes between the two, in order to emphasise the contribution public interest journalism can make to a media outlet’s viability. Editorial values: values are beliefs that shape how we behave. Editorial values shape journalists’ day-to- day decisions about story selection and how stories are covered. These decisions are often instinctive and may vary from outlet to outlet and journalist to journalist.Ethical principles: ethics are what we consider to be right and how we ought to behave. Ethical principles of journalism are usually captured in professional codes that determine how journalism should be practiced. Impact: lasting change which, in this case, journalism contributes towards, directly and/or indirectly. Income stream: a sustained and recurring source of income into a business, such as membership fees, subscriptions, advertising, and services. One-off sources may include a time-specific crowdfunding campaign. Journalism: the practice of gathering, analysing, and presenting fact-based news and information to the public (see also ‘public interest journalism’ below). Media viability: a field within the media development sector that focuses on the enabling economic conditions and resource implications that affect media organisations. It is a systems approach.1 Public interest journalism: ethical, editorially- independent, fact-based journalism that informs the public about key issues in ways that serve the public interest rather than any political, commercial or factional interest; encourages and contributes to public debate; holds those in power to account; and challenges discriminatory societal norms.Public interest media: editorially-independent media outlets that strive to produce and distribute public interest journalism.

Conclusion Journalism is no longer the exclusive domain of professionals working for specific institutions. Increasingly, public interest journalism is defined by the ways it is practiced, the quality of stories it produces and their impact – rather than by the institutions and individuals telling these stories. Journalists have innovated in response to the seismic changes of the past three decades, while borrowing from other related and not-so-related fields: social change communication, documentary film, literature, computer science, and computer gaming, for example. Journalists are also having to develop new skills, such as data analysis, coding, mindfulness, critical thinking, and active listening. However, the application of ethical standards and editorial values – with the intention of having a beneficial impact on society – continues to distinguish public interest journalism from other forms of information and storytelling. And therein lies public interest journalism’s value and, arguably, its route to sustainability. Unlocking this value involves balancing the sometimes-competing interests of different stakeholders who have the means and motives to sustain public interest journalism. Based on the research and other literature reviewed in this chapter, the handbook’s framework and guide endeavours to provide journalists and their editorial teams with a useful way to design and implement editorial strategies that connect valuable, value-driven, and ethical journalistic practice with the impact they want their journalism to have. The evidence suggests the more that journalists and media outlets make a difference to the lives of people in their audiences and society, the more likely those people will be to give them the time, attention, data, support, goodwill, solidarity, and money so desperately needed to sustain public interest journalism.

    "output": "to social justice. Journalists in Africa, Asia, Eastern and Central Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East and North Africa have been in the forefront of the digital media start-up revolution, exploring innovative ways to produce journalism that both appeals to audiences and helps pay the bills while remaining true to their ethical principles and editorial values. These pioneers inspired IMS mantra of ‘good journalism, better societies’. The ’good journalism, better societies’ framework distils learning from these experiences and wider research. This framework provides a structure for the handbook’s step-by-step guide to designing and implementing editorial strategies that help editorial teams make sense of their situation, what they want to achieve with their public interest journalism and how they want to achieve it.The framework envisages journalists embedding ethical principles and editorial values throughout the editorial process – from research to production, distribution and audience engagement with their stories - in a way that creates value for those best placed to sustain public interest journalism: the audience, the media outlet and the society it serves. This involves producing ‘stories that matter’6; stories that meet ethical standards, reflect editorial values, have impact and create value for these stakeholders. Because of the value they derive from this journalism and the impact it has, stakeholders are more likely to give their money, time, attention, data, support, goodwill, solidarity and other in-kind contributions that journalists and media outlets can use to sustain their public interest journalism. It would be difficult to achieve this with every story. Rather, the framework represents an approach that shapes an editorial team’s journalism over time, or in a specific project such as an investigation, a new product or a series of stories on a particular theme. This is done by implementing an editorial strategy that editorial teams review and adjust as they go, steering their coverage towards the desired impact and value they want their journalism to have. This gives direction to individual products and projects that can then utilise IMS’ Impact Framework for Media Projects .7 6 Our use of this term is inspired by the journalism described in Deuze, M. and Witschge, T.

Therefore, public interest journalism must also create value for those who provide the resources needed to sustain it, notably: • The outlet’s audience. • Those with a stake in the media outlet: owners, advertisers and journalists. • The society the outlet ultimately serves. Each of these stakeholder groups may value journalism differently and their motives for sustaining it with their money, data, attention, time, effort, support and solidarity may vary. Sustaining public interest journalism is a balancing act between various, sometimes conflicting interests that come together around shared values. Editorial strategies This handbook outlines how editorial teams5 can design and implement strategies for striking this delicate balance in their day-to-day journalism. It is based on a framework for ‘good journalism, better societies’ that combines the various elements touched on above. This framework provides a basis for producing sustainable public interest journalism. By monitoring and regularly assessing how well their strategy is progressing, editorial teams can: • Refine the way they practice their public interest journalism • Hold each other accountable in a mutually supportive way • Work towards their desired impact and creating value. 3 Ideally, journalists and editors work with managers, marketing, technological and operational colleagues so that a media outlet’s business and revenue models support the implementation of its editorial strategy and vice-versa. Chapter 2: A framework for ‘good journalism, better societies’ 11 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Chapter 2: A framework for ‘good journalism, better societies’Chapter 2: A framework for ‘good journalism, better societies’ Why a framework? Seismic changes in how journalism is produced, consumed and financed have prompted a lot of introspection and research that re-evaluates both the role and practice of journalism. Much of this has focussed on Europe and North America, where journalism’s once prosperous business model has been turned upside down. In other parts of the world, public interest journalism has always been a tough and a largely unviable venture, but there is also a long tradition dating back more than a century of entrepreneurial journalism committed",

    "output": "service programming”. At the centre of the organisation’s 2015-18 strategy was the “sustained production and distribution of ethical, professional and diverse public interest media content”, which the 2020-2023 strategy referred to as “ethical and inclusive public interest content”. Like most media organisations, IMS deferred to internationally recognised ethical standards for journalism as benchmarks for how this content should look and sound. In 2018, IMS committed to four ethical principles of journalism – accuracy, independence, fairness, and accountability – while also being “guided” by a fifth: humanity.9 These principles were distilled from more than 400 ethical guidelines and journalistic codes of practice from all over world. However, many of these codes pre-dated the digital era. The latest IMS strategy embraces the role that journalists and other content producers play “in transforming societies for the wellbeing of the public”, which requires the sustained production and distribution of “ethical, fact-based and gender-transformative public interest journalism and other media content”.10 Public interest journalism “informs members of the public about issues that shape their lives in ways that: serve the public’s rather than any political, commercial or factional interest; encourage and inform public debate; hold those in power to account; and challenge discriminatory societal norms.”11 Journalists can practice this kind of journalism by: • Deploying effective strategies to understand and reflect the needs of their targeted audience segments, including marginalised and underserved communities. • Amplifying the voices of marginalised and vulnerable groups, where possible, by enhancing the representation of these communities in media outlets and the content outlets produce. • Using audience and data insights to make decisions about such content. • Developing codes of conduct and using these to self- monitor and self-regulate editorial standards and organisational processes to complement inclusive and independent regulatory mechanisms.12 Contested norms Journalists, media activists, and academics are questioning how a traditional understanding of journalism’s role in relatively stable and prosperous liberal democracies has been applied uncritically to less liberal, less stable, less prosperous, and less democratic societies.13 In such places, journalists who strive to uphold rights-based, internationally recognised ethics in pursuit of social justice often do so at great risk in rapidly changing societies with colonial and authoritarian traditions, where media is less well-resourced yet invariably innovative.For over a century, generations of journalists in Africa, Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and the Middle East have campaigned for social justice by challenging slavery, colonialism, apartheid, and autocracy. In the early 2000s, with the post-Cold War wave of democratisation surging through much of the world, Berger tried to ‘re-engineer’ traditional theories of media and democracy to reflect the realities of media freedom and the growth of privately- owned media in southern Africa.14 Meanwhile, Nyamnjoh argued that democratisation had been accompanied by “a crisis of ethics” in African journalism, with journalism showing “little creativity … in terms of reflecting the 9 IMS (2018).

    "output": "identify the beneficial value that journalism has for their audiences, advertisers, investors, society, and to practice journalism that creates this value. Research and a growing body of experience indicates that the benefits these stakeholders expect – in return for their money, attention, data, time, participation, and solidarity – are often determined by the impact they would like media to have; the kind of impact public interest journalism also strives for. The framework in Chapter 3 pulls together the different ingredients needed to produce public interest journalism that has a beneficial impact and creates value for those key stakeholders who ultimately determine whether journalists can keep producing it. To balance these competing and often conflicting interests, journalists need a clear sense of where they are heading and how they want to get there. They need a strategy that guides and shapes their day-to- day journalism and an outlet’s efforts to capture the value this journalism creates.Using the handbook 6 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Using the handbook Pick and choose We understand that few media can afford the time and space to follow this handbook’s strategy design- and-implementation process from start to finish, our suggestion would be to pick and choose sections and steps that speak to specific needs at a particular time. Some of the steps work best when journalists and their marketing colleagues, data analysts and technologists collaborate; this will encourage the teamwork between roles needed to harmonise an outlet’s public interest journalism output with its business model. But some of the steps also lend themselves to smaller groups. In places, decision makers may want to take the lead. The steps can be followed by a whole team in a workshop setting, by a few people sitting around a table, or by a single person at their desk. The guide is intended to fit into existing workflows as easily as possible. Teams might want to work with an experienced facilitator, who can help guide them through the process. IMS and other media development initiatives might be able to assist teams with this.Who the handbook is for The handbook is aimed at two main audiences: • The practical guidance (chapters 3 and 4) is primarily for journalists and media leaders as well as their marketing and operational colleagues who form a strategic editorial team.2 • The sections that contextualise and explain this guidance are aimed at a wider audience: media development practitioners, policy makers, donors, educators, and researchers as well as journalists and media leaders. The handbook adopts two distinct styles to distinguish between the following two types of content: • The sections that contextualise and explain the approach look like this and refer to journalists and other members of editorial teams as ‘they’, because these sections are written for the wider audience. • THE PRACTICAL SECTIONS look like this and are written in the second-person plural (‘you’) to denote that these sections speak directly to members of the editorial teams. These sections include step-by-step guidance on how to design, implement, monitor, and evaluate an editorial",

    "output": "Our personal behaviour is not cut off from public discourses and our actions do not happen in a cultural vacuum.” With this in mind, civic groups and documentary filmmakers in southern Africa teamed up to run screenings in community settings of the award-winning Steps for the Future documentary films about HIV and AIDS. Having watched one, the audience were invited to participate in discussions facilitated by activists and, in some cases, by people featured in the films who could address any misconceptions the audience had – about the disease and people living with HIV – in a diplomatic and culturally sensitive way that encouraged changes in attitudes and behaviour within the society.126 49 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Key termsHow this handbook was collated an outstanding example of public interest journalism from a part of the world where IMS operates, and to explain their choice. Themes from these findings guided the author’s review of research and grey literature, which he analysed in relation to IMS’ global strategy130 and the ethical principles of journalism to which IMS subscribes.131 Based on this analysis, the author drafted the framework and guide and discussed them with a purposive sample of nine critical friends: four publishers (two women and two men), four media development practitioners (three women, one man), and two academics (men). These discussions focussed on the relevance and usability of the framework and guide. The author also tried out parts of the guide during a strategic planning workshop he facilitated for a non-profit media outlet serving his hometown. Based on this feedback and piloting, the author then refined the framework and guide. The process had the following shortcomings: • There were relatively few responses to the voluntary survey. Most of the IMS leaders who responded came from the same country, while most IMS staff were based in the organisation’s headquarters in Copenhagen. Therefore, the findings gave little more than a feel for what some colleagues and partners understood public interest journalism to be in practice. • The process ran alongside others, resulting in pauses and a loss of momentum from time to time. However, this also allowed for further reflection and the incorporation of new information in between stops and starts, which helped the iteration. 128 A community of practice for IMS staff with specific expertise and experience in IMS’ support to journalism. The working group was convened by IMS’ Journalism Hub (J-Hub), a crosscutting knowledge unit within IMS, which spreads expertise between programmes, shares insights, and facilitates learning to inspire innovation. 129 Five media leaders and 10 IMS staff responded. Eight of the 15 respondents were women. 130 IMS (2023). 131 IMS (2023).This handbook is the product of an iterative process involving workshops, a short survey, a literature review, and discussions undertaken between January 2023 and March 2025, which aimed to unpack what ‘good journalism, better societies’ means in practice. Given the upheavals in media in recent years, IMS wanted to deepen its understanding of: • What constitutes public interest journalism, particularly in the regions where IMS operates.",

How will you know if your journalism is creating this value - what information can you collect to measure this? 3. What value, if any, does your journalism currently create for each stakeholder, according to the information you have available?Chapter 4 / Step 3: Creating value Tips: 1. Keep in mind that practical benefits often lead to longer-term, essential benefits, e.g. self-expression and a connection with other people can lead to a sense of belonging. 2. Each category of stakeholder is likely to be made up of different groups of people. Each group may perceive differently the benefits of journalism. In which case, you could start by identifying which groups within each stakeholder category have the most influence over the sustainability of your journalism and focus on these groups when you try to answer the questions. 3. The best way to find out how journalism benefits your key stakeholders is to ask them. You could convene panels of people from each group to discuss the questions. You could include a mix of people from the most influential groups in each stakeholder panel. Your stakeholder panels can also help you to evaluate how well you are implementing your strategy during Step 7. 4. Once you have a sense of the benefits your key stakeholders derive from journalism, you can gather the editorial team to discuss these findings during the prioritisation exercise. Again, you could divide into three groups – 1) audience, 2) media outlet and 3) society. Each group discusses and answers the questions in relation to their assigned stakeholder and then presents their ideas to the whole team for further discussion and agreement on the desired impact. If the team is small, you can brainstorm together.Use the worksheet for Step 3 to record what you decide (see example, and template in the Appendix section).

Value is often in our minds. We perceive value both in terms of how practical and useful something is (its ‘instrumental value’) as well as its longer-lasting benefits to our wellbeing (its ‘intrinsic value’). Instrumental value usually contributes towards intrinsic value. For example, having a meal with friends or family, which has instrumental value, may contribute to our happiness, which has intrinsic value. Our perception of something’s value determines what we are willing to give in return, not just in terms of money but also our time, attention and personal information, as well as in-kind contributions such as effort, participation, commitment and support. Different people may value public interest journalism in different ways and for different reasons. For example, audience members might value being informed about what is going on in a way that helps them make decisions about their day-to-day lives (instrumental value), which may ultimately help them feel part of their community and contribute towards their wellbeing (intrinsic value). Advertisers send messages and sell products on the back of this relationship between a media outlet and its audience (instrumental value), which enables the company to create wealth (intrinsic value). The value journalism creates for the audience and advertisers generates the money media owners need to produce the journalism and run their media operations (instrumental value). But media owners and investors may also value the prestige and influence journalism gives them (intrinsic value). Journalists, on the other hand, may earn an income from their journalism (intrinsic value), but their role of finding things out and keeping people informed may also give journalists prestige and job satisfaction (intrinsic value). These stakeholders and other members of society may also value how journalism explains what public officials are doing on their behalf and holds those with power to account (instrumental value). This can provide different groups in society with a sense of common purpose and identity, which in turn may contribute towards social cohesion and development (intrinsic value). This can also create value for donors, philanthropists and, ideally, governments who need journalists to keep the public informed (instrumental value) if they are to deliver on their political or developmental goals (intrinsic value). Therefore, the value public interest journalism creates goes beyond just reach (the number of people who read, watch or listen to a story) and attention (the time they spend reading, watching or listening to a story). Stakeholders may equate value with how they use and experience journalism as well as the way it reflects their own values and beliefs and the beneficial impact it has on their lives and their society. This can result in an exchange of benefits – ‘reciprocity value’ – when a stakeholder creates value for another",

For example, healthcare workers are committed to providing empathetic care, while the ability to create empathy is the hallmark of a good book, film, or play:26 ‘“When I go to a great movie I can live somebody else’s life for a while. I can walk in somebody else’s shoes. I can see what it feels like to be a member of a different gender, a different race, a different economic class, to live in a different time, to have a different belief’”.27 With algorithms and software using emotional cues to get audiences’ attention and to prolong engagement, “journalists need to … adopt new storytelling techniques such as scrolling texts and gamification that create pleasure and empathy for audiences while also imparting serious information and challenging ideas, thereby reaffirming traditional – and much neglected – journalism values such as transparency, expertise, and independent and critical reporting and analysis”.28 41 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Key termsChapter 5: The evidence ‘“Here we changed everything. From proposing the theme, the focus and, above all, highlighting stories that were of interest to them (the women social leaders) or their communities, their struggles or needs. This is how we met their need for communication and representation.”’ The PRIMED programme41 found that a combination of strategies and interventions by three media partners in three different contexts over three years managed to improve gender representation in the following areas:42 • Workplace gender equality • Gender-sensitive and gender-balanced content • Increasing the media outlets’ reach and appeal to women. Different interventions and approaches seemed to complement and reinforce each other, reaffirming the importance of clearly defining gender goals and implementing practical, achievable initiatives to obtain the desired changes.43 A key determining factor, however, seemed to be the level of commitment from an organisation’s leadership.Transformative ‘public good’ IMS’ mantra ‘good journalism, better societies’ implies that journalism should help improve the communities it serves; journalism is not a passive portrayal of events, it should contribute towards constructive social change, whether a shift in an individual’s mindset or the things people do collectively to improve their lives and the lives of others around them. The wish to inspire and galvanise constructive change motivates the journalism of most IMS partners and resonates through the “journalism that matters” and “democratic resistance” that Deuze and Wietschge find in their study of digital start-ups around the world.44 It also seems to encapsulate the concept of journalism as a public good: “…information that empowers citizens to exercise their fundamental rights, supports gender equality and allows for the participation and trust in democratic governance and sustainable development”.45 This sense of agency and transformation resonates too in the active verbs – ‘promote, ‘grant, ‘enable’, ‘challenge, ‘encourage, ‘hold’, and so on – that pepper contemporary definitions of public interest journalism and public interest news. 34 Marimbe, S.

Peaceful, stable societies based on democratic values rely on ethical and critical journalism that aims to include, not divide. www.mediasupport.orgSummary Foreword4 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practiceA publisher’s view I have experienced the value that quality journalism brings to society and its positive impact on individuals and communities. This core tenet drove the mission, editorial strategy, and business model of the popular independent digital magazine I founded and published in autocratic Belarus. It was shared by our editorial team and communicated to our audience through the content we published. Our editorial values – printed on a poster and proudly displayed in our newsroom – guided our content choices and commercial partnerships. These values were not only the foundation for every action we took as a media outlet; they were also our main asset and the key to our success in gaining readers and business partners. And they proved essential in helping the magazine to survive political and economic repression and exile. Even though a value-based approach was at the core of our work, implementing it was not always easy. We spent considerable time turning our values into guidelines and processes that every team member – from editors and journalists to project managers and designers – could follow day-to-day. Measuring and capturing the value our journalism created posed another major challenge. We were steadfast in remaining true to the magazine’s mission, values, and editorial independence while entering commercial part - nerships. This sometimes led to tough negotiations, so it was important to have our principles in writing. We had to act intuitively, be inventive, and scramble to find rele - vant examples and best practices across the media sector. We would have benefited significantly from IMS’ Values, value, and impact handbook, which offers a holistic methodology and ready-to-use tools designed to assist any mission-driven media outlet. It demonstrates how any media outlet can integrate its value proposition into the editorial and business sides of its operations, effectively bridging them. Whether you are part of an established media organisation seeking to further articulate and assess its values and impact, or a media start-up team at the beginning of your journey, this handbook will not only save your outlet time and resources but also strengthen its mission, audience, and market stance. Perhaps most importantly, it will spotlight the impact your media is generating in its communities, boosting the spirit of your team and",

    "output": "Good luck and enjoy the journey. David Lush, journalist, publisher and media development consultant, United Kingdom.Foreword 5 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Using the handbook Values, value, and impact provides practical guidance on how to design and implement bespoke editorial strategies for producing and disseminating public interest journalism that: • Embodies a media outlet’s ethical principles and editorial values. • Has the impact an outlet strives for. • Creates value for those with the resources to sustain an outlet’s public interest journalism. Chapter 1 explains the reasons for the handbook and its approach. Chapter 2 explains the key ingredients of this approach and how these come together in IMS’ values, value, and impact framework. Chapter 3 summarises key shifts in the ethics, values, and practice of journalism due to the seismic changes over recent decades in how journalism is produced and consumed. Chapter 4 provides a step-by-step guide for media outlets to design and implement a bespoke editorial strategy for producing their own brand of impactful and valuable public interest journalism. Chapter 5 presents the evidence that informs this approach and how the handbook was collated.Why editorial strategies? An editorial strategy focusses on journalism and the role of journalists in achieving a media outlet’s goals. This is different to a content strategy, which tends to cover all forms of content, including advertising, with a focus on marketing and an emphasis on data analysis and sales. While an editorial strategy must embrace many aspects of a content strategy, particularly when it comes to journalism’s relationship with its audience, this handbook’s distinction between the two emphasises the contribution public interest journalism can make to a media outlet’s drive for viability. It treats public interest journalism as a media outlet’s main asset. In the past, few newsrooms needed an editorial strategy. Journalists produced stories day-in, day-out, with little consideration for their impact and how they benefitted the people who ultimately paid for these stories to be produced: the audience, advertisers, media outlet’s owners, investors, and funders. Yes, journalists wanted their stories to have an impact and, invariably, this related to vague notions of journalism’s role in a democracy: informing and educating the public and being a ‘watchdog’ over those with power and authority. But this impact was seldom articulated as goals or outcomes that a newsroom’s team of journalists would then strive for. Nor did they have much idea of what benefit, if any, their journalism had for the people who ultimately paid the bills.But as audiences and advertisers have migrated en masse to other platforms, journalists can no longer be so blasé about the impact their stories have and the value they create. The media’s panicked response to the apparent collapse of its traditional business model has been to see impact and value in terms of clicks and attention, as this is how Internet search engines and social media algorithms reward content producers, usually at the expense of ethical journalistic standards and editorial values. This challenges media committed to public interest journalism to play to their strengths; to",

Public interest journalism is increasingly defined by the ways in which it is practiced, the qualities of stories produced, and the impact they have rather than by the institutions and individuals telling these stories. Ethical standards and editorial values continue to distinguish journalism from other forms of information and storytelling, while the aim of having a beneficial impact on society sets public interest journalism apart from other forms of content creation. This is what IMS means by its mantra ‘good journalism, better societies’. In the parts of the world where IMS works, public interest journalism has always been a tough and a largely unviable venture, but there is a tradition, dating back more than a century, of entrepreneurial journalism committed to social justice. If it is to survive and thrive, public interest journalism should also benefit – create value for – people with the money, attention, data, time, commitment, ideas, solidarity, and other resources needed to sustain it: audiences, media outlets – their owners, journalists, advertisers investors and donors – as well as the societies they belong to and serve. To balance the continuous, competing, and often conflicting interests of these various stakeholders, journalists need a clear sense of where they are heading and how they want to get there. This handbook presents a methodology for editorial teams – editors and journalists working together with their managerial, marketing, technological, and operational colleagues – to design and implement bespoke editorial strategies for producing and disseminating public interest journalism that: • Embodies a media outlet’s ethical principles and editorial values. • Has the impact the team strives for. • Creates value for those with the resources to sustain their public interest journalism. This approach endeavours to harmonise journalism and business models by treating public interest journalism as a mission-driven media outlet’s main asset.Publisher IMS (International Media Support) May 2025 Author: David Lush Editor: Dr Clare Cook Research assistant: Synne Bjerkestrand Layout: Vitali Dzehtsiarou Artworks: Temujen Gunawardena and Blanche Ellis Copy editor: Mike Ormsby Acknowledgements: This handbook draws on the the author’s PhD research with the University of Lancashire’s Media Innovation Studio, supervised by Dr François Nel and Dr Clive Palmer.

Digital Journalism 8/2. p.175–94. 24 Ibid, p.180. 40 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Key termsChapter 5: The evidence However, journalists might need more than empathy to address the social injustices that audiences may experience:29 “News reporting ... often encourages audience empathy instead of solidarity by representing social injustice as individual problems…This distinction is important because strictly evoking empathy for individuals places journalism on a trajectory to suggest individualistic remedies to an issue…., whereas inviting solidarity charts a course for large-scale social change.” Comparing the coverage of homelessness by media outlets in San Franscisco, USA, Varma distinguishes between empathy and solidarity, the latter being a political commitment to addressing social injustice that translates into collective action.30 While coverage by the mainstream San Franscisco Chronicle stirred empathy for the homeless, it focussed on individuals and their problems but overlooked systemic issues that contribute to homelessness in the city. The digital start-up AlterNet, on the other hand, portrayed a community of homeless people living with shared struggles, such as not having access to basic amenities, dealing with the city’s practices of confiscating their possessions, and not being able to afford housing despite working fulltime jobs. This coverage sought systemic solutions to the systemic conditions that denigrated their collective dignity. Empathy is arguably a step towards addressing social injustices, Varma concludes, but does not address the politics and systemic causes of these injustices:31 “Whether journalism facilitates incremental change (by encouraging empathy) or fosters societal transformation (by inviting solidarity) begins with how journalists humanize marginalized communities, which, in turn, charts a course for the possibilities for social change.”Inclusivity and diversity Journalists with similar backgrounds and life experiences are arguably best placed to empathise with their story subjects and audience members. If public interest journalism is to “amplify the voices of marginalised and vulnerable groups”, as IMS’ current global strategy envisions,32 then members of these communities need to be more involved:33 “Media content does not reflect society if the newsroom does not reflect society. On the contrary, newsrooms that have a preponderance of a specific group tend to sideline the voices, perspectives, and interests of other groups. IMS will therefore continue to support the development of inclusive workspaces, free from discrimination and harassment, through inclusive and transformative policies and mechanisms.” 25 Davis et. al. in Varma, A.
