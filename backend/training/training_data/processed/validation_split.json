    "output": "factual errors might be introduced. Your solution could be introducing clear guidelines to your journalists and editors, noting that any AI-enhanced text should always be reviewed by a human editor who can check for factual accuracy, while ensuring originality and proper attribution. For newsrooms creating specialised AI assistants (e.g., Custom GPTs, Claude Projects, Copilot Agents), clearly instruct these tools with journalistic standards. For example, you might instruct an AI assistant with the following: “You’re helping our investigative team. Always prioritise source protection and flag potential ethical issues”. Your solution should also address protecting information shared with free AI tools, which may be stored on external servers and used to train their models. You can establish clear guidelines—for instance, prohibiting the uploading of unpublished drafts, source identities, or confidential documents to external AI platforms.

Their “democratic resistance” comes in the form of “stories that matter”,17 which is perhaps epitomised by the “counter journalism” of the Febrayer Network, a group of media start-ups from the Middle East and North Africa.18 Practitioners of new and innovative genres and formats – such as constructive, alternative, and sustainable journalism – are attempting to stay more in touch with, and thus relevant to, their increasingly fragmented audiences Technological change has also led to new journalistic methods: data journalism, mobile journalism, user generated content, gaming, and others, all of which push and sometimes cross the traditional boundaries of journalism.

Participants and presenters said that involving young people in storytelling helps to build empathy and trust with young audiences:37 “The greatest opportunity in reaching young audiences with social media is letting them tell their story in their own way.” A leading Colombian newspaper El Espectador teamed up with a civil society organisation, the Women’s Initiative for Peace Alliance (IMP), to provide 15 women activists with the platform to tell their own stories about the country’s peace process.38 The activists decided what stories to tell, how to tell them, where to go, who to interview, what to publish, and what not to publish.39 Journalists guided the exercise, but women social leaders made the decisions, changing the usual journalistic routines in the process:40 42 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Key termsChapter 5: The evidence Accountability and transparency The need for journalism to be empathetic, inclusive, diverse, and transformative also challenges journalists to think differently about editorial independence. The 2018 IMS ethical principles of journalism envisaged “a clear separation between owners, advertisers, and funders on the one hand and editorial decision making on the other”.50 This is impossible for most smaller media outlets invariably owned by journalists involved in generating much-needed revenue,51 and all the more reason for them to be transparent, accountable, and live up to the values they espouse, by: • Explaining how stories are produced and how data is used. • Being upfront about their core",

In this ethical vacuum, the values of a news outlet, individual journalists, and their audiences may now have a greater influence, on how journalism is practiced, than professional codes of ethics. Commercial, political, and social pressures can push journalism further away from ethical standards, given the financial rewards that online platforms offer to clickbait and disinformation. But this prioritisation, of reach over quality, undermines what distinguishes journalism from other forms of information, not to mention journalism’s credibility. As a result, there seems to be a growing consensus that public interest values can and should enhance a media outlet’s viability and, thereby, the sustainability of its public interest journalism. News values reflecting a range influences, from workplace routines to ideology, have long determined what stories journalists and media outlets choose to cover; they become part of a newsroom culture that journalists absorb and internalise.57 But journalism cultures vary from country to country.58 59 When comparing the perceptions of Vietnamese and Singaporean journalists, for example, Lehmann- Jacobsen identified five journalistic “ideals” that “guide journalists in the two countries and serve as a legitimising base for their profession”.60 And while journalists from both countries orientated themselves around three similar ideals, their “interpretation and consecration” of these ideals differed because of a complex interplay of influencing factors – notably the countries’ political systems.61 Journalists in both countries were also cognizant of and respected the publics’ expectations, but responded to these expectations differently too, as illustrated by these quotations from two of the journalists Lehmann-Jacobsen interviewed:62 ‘“I mean in terms of the public we bear the burden of being seen as propaganda and also being compliant and… and that’s one… That’s the baggage that we have. But in the new day and age because information is so cheaply available – it’s free – they tend to not think that the work you do is valuable”’ (Singaporean journalist).“The audience is much better informed and know many things already. It is therefore up to the journalists to provide them with something new. They are not listening in the same way as they used to – and that has made our jobs as journalists more difficult. We have to be more creative and find new angles on stories” (Vietnamese journalist). Wasserman and Maweu found that owners’ and shareholders’ interests directly and indirectly influenced the ethical decisions of journalists working for East Africa’s largest media group, Nation Media, mainly through their appointment of the company’s top executives and the ‘“silent policies”’ put in place to protect owners’ and shareholders’ interests.63 From a societal perspective, Leal found that conventional news values and theories about news consumption may not automatically apply to poor or marginalised people in polarised societies such as South Africa.64 55 See https://whomakesthenews.org 56 IMS",

    "output": "may put political or factional interests above those of the broader public in their dealings with the media. To create value for those who ultimately sustain their journalism, editorial teams constantly balance these various interests and may have to prioritise some stakeholders more than others. An editorial team’s guiding star is the beneficial impact they want their journalism to have, while their ethical principles and editorial values are their compass. ‘Stories that matter’ By balancing ethical principles, editorial values, and value creation, journalists produce ‘stories that matter’ for their audience, their media outlet and the society it serves. These are stories that, on the one hand, embody the ethical principles and editorial values that stakeholders associate with the outlet and public interest journalism, and, on the other hand, they are stories that meet these stakeholders’ needs and provide them with the benefits they are looking for. Editorial teams can maintain this balance by regularly reviewing and, if necessary, adjusting their editorial strategy.Stories with impact This review and adjustment of their strategy helps editorial teams steer towards the impact they want their journalism to have. This impact can vary significantly depending on the goals and priorities of different news teams and the media they work for. For example, a team might want its stories to help audience members improve their livelihoods or to give audience members pleasure. The team may want its journalism to help put the media outlet on a more viable footing by generating more revenue. At a societal level, a team may want its journalism to help encourage voter turnout or curb corruption; impact that demonstrates their journalism’s importance to other members of society. Again, this might involve balancing the interests of different stakeholders who may be looking for different types of impact. An editorial strategy provides the team with a clear sense of direction, the tools to navigate the journey and the means to demonstrate their impact. Chapter 3: Shifts in journalism norms 17 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Chapter 3: Shifts in journalism norms Chapter 3: Shifts in journalism norms Journalists have been forced to reassess their profession since audiences and advertisers deserted mainstream media for social media platforms – where public interest journalism struggles to be noticed, let alone to compete with all the other information and content available. This has prompted changes – some subtle, others more fundamental – in how public interest journalism is normally understood and practiced. These shifts in journalistic norms try to make public interest journalism more relevant, more appealing and more impactful, and distinct from disinformation. Some of the more noticeable shifts are summarised below, along with related questions editorial teams might consider. The list is not exhaustive but may inspire journalists and media outlets as they design their editorial strategies.ACCURACY: reporting and verifying facts based on research, first-hand sources or being on the scene.

    "output": "research to involving the audience in content creation, the role and importance of audiences in this new era of journalism is both exciting and requires continual reflection, iteration, and a willingness to try new approaches.” The experiences of some IMS media partners suggests that “being upfront about their values seems to give these media the confidence to experiment with both income generating and storytelling formats”:89 “Some of these formats are risqué and purists might question their adherence to ethical journalistic standards, but these partners seem able to push these boundaries without crossing them because it remains clear to everyone that these formats are consistent with their values.” Emotional intelligence As journalism opens up to its “emotional turn”,90 emotional intelligence – our ability to recognise and manage emotions – enables journalists to deal with the wide range of emotions that they encounter in their work.91 “Moral 47 V alues, value, and impact ‘Good journalism, better societies’ in practice Key termsChapter 5: The evidence ‘“Genuine participation generates a strong sense of community ownership whereby the media is demystified because community members see and understand for themselves how the medium works.”’115 This involves “active listening”, wherein a media outlet moves beyond just representing a community of people or acting as the “voice of the voiceless” and instead provides a space where a community can speak out and receive attention.116 Commercial considerations often discourage such active listening journalism, even within community media outlets:117 “The impetus for listening is usually driven by a desire to understand a local situation and… to build a strong relationship of loyalty with a particular readership or audience. The impulse is also a social justice one – to take responsibility for redressing the inequalities of the democratic present.” The ten-step Citizen’s Agenda118 model, which is designed to shape journalists’ election coverage based on what audiences want to know rather than what politicians want to say, starts with journalists listening to what their audiences would like politicians to talk about.119 The “voters’ agenda” that arises from this process then becomes the template for journalists’ coverage of the campaign.120If translated into journalism practice, the “story listening” method that enabled former child soldiers to create an animated film based on their shared experiences of the Colombian civil war “could offer a more inclusive and bottom-up approach” to storytelling.121 User needs and social change There was a time when journalists paid little attention to what their audience wanted or needed. But as audiences have abandoned mainstream media for other platforms, journalists have embraced story telling methods that address “user needs” by providing audience members with information they find pleasing and useful.122 This approach is based on “uses and gratification theory”, which “relies on the notion of the audience simply as a collection of diverse, isolated individuals each of whom will read the media according to her or his own needs and interests”.123 This risks overlooking: • How audience members interact with and make sense of journalism within their social and professional settings. • What impact – if any – this interaction and interpretation might have on",
